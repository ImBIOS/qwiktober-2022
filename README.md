## 🫗 Project Structure

Inside of you project, you'll see the following directories and files:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── routes/
        └── ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and `index.tsx` files as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## ⚒️ Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). For Qwik during development, the `dev` command will also server-side render (SSR) the output. The client-side development modules loaded by the browser.

```
npm run dev
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite will request many JS files, which does not represent a Qwik production build.


### 🔨 Local development

The [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) can be used to preview a production build locally. To do so: First build your site, then to start a local server, run:

1. install Netlify CLI globally `npm i -g netlify-cli`
2. Build your site both ssr and client `npm run build`.
3. Start a local server with `npm run serve`.
   In this project, `npm run serve` uses the `netlify dev` command to spin up a server that can handle Netlify's Edge Functions locally.
4. Visit [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) to check out your site.
